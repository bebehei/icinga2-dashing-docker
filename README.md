# icinga2-dashing-docker
Icinga2 dashing docker image

Bad code quality.

Build this thing, and then run the image with the corresponding variables in Dockerfile. This will immediately give you a good overview what dashing is able to do

I found out for myself, dashing won't work. icingaweb2 will suit my needs much better.
